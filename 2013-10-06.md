One on one office hour with Aaron

Sunday morning, Yoojin (Integrator) brought her presentation to discuss with Aaron.

#####Improvement:
* Visalization: it is hard to understand at first sight; notice that the visuals' color may appear differently on the projectror. the unexpected is a great tool to use
what are the next steps
* we have data but we want information
* this bubble says here's the genius in the class (big blue)
* think of something that provacative; convince audience -> give something that is provacative
* what will you do to draw the class in 
* make them walk away with something to think about
* __with graphic, turn data into information then turn information into insgiht__
insight isn't about convincing but about helping them see a world that they didn't know
