visalization
the unexpected is a great tool to use
what are the next steps
we have data but we want information
this bubble says here's the genius in the class
think of something that provacative
convince audience -> give something that is provacative
what will you do to draw the class in 
make them walk away with something to think about
with graphic, turn data into information
with that information, turn information into insgiht
insight isn't about convincing but about helping them see a world that they didn't know
