####Thoughts and Recommendations:

Alisha:
Looked at the final code and discussed ideas for the presentation tomorrow. I think the presentation looks great, especially with the updated visual/graph. I added some instructions to the README.md file so that the instructor will be able to execute the R code on his computer.

Raymond:
Graph / Visual may not be broadcasted on projector clearly. Initial graph were bubbles with solid circles, but bigger circles would sometimes cover the smaller circles and hiding some important data. I then decided to change points to a circle with just a border, but issues of visibility on the projector got brought up. Final visual includes the solid circles, but adding a function to make the circles transparent.
