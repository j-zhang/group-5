####Thoughts and Recommendations:

Graph / Visual may not be broadcasted on projector clearly. Initial graph were bubbles with solid circles, but bigger circles would sometimes cover the smaller circles and hiding some important data. I then decided to change points to a circle with just a border, but issues of visibility on the projector got brought up. Final visual includes the solid circles, but adding a function to make the circles transparent.

+ To further the analysis, we could break the visual / graph down between different learning styles and analyze how they stand in relation to each other and the number of skills learned. 
  + A question would also be around is this more descriptive or conclusive with 31 data points, since 17 were omitted?
+ Moving forward, our group could use iPython Notebook as a way to present, even though it was coded in R. 
+ Overall, I think we focused on the process and tried to answer an interesting question, and learn more about our classmates and any shared characteristics among students who are comfortable at being a technical lead, going beyond analyzing two variables against each other and plotting to see what the relationship is.
+ We could also look into other creative visualizations.
