####Thoughts and Recommendations:

Graph / Visual may not be broadcasted on projector clearly. Initial grpah were bubbles with solid circles, but bigger circles would sometimes cover the smaller circles and hiding some important data. I then decided to change points to a circle with just a border, but issues of visibility on the projector got brought up. Final visual includes the solid circles, but adding a function to make the circles transparent.
