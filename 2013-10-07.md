####Thoughts and Recommendations: 

__Alisha__:
Looked at the final code and discussed ideas for the presentation tomorrow. I think the presentation looks great, especially with the updated visual/graph. I added some instructions to the README.md file so that the instructor will be able to execute the R code on his computer. Our group did a great job of communicating and I am happy with our final product. However, I hope that next time we will be able to use iPython notebook instead of R to analyze data. 

__Raymond__:
Graph / Visual may not be broadcasted on projector clearly. Initial graph were bubbles with solid circles, but bigger circles would sometimes cover the smaller circles and hiding some important data. I then decided to change points to a circle with just a border, but issues of visibility on the projector got brought up. Final visual includes the solid circles, but adding a function to make the circles transparent.

__Yoojin__:
I am glad our group 1) started early 2) met often 3) discussed with Aaron thoroughly to know what to expect. As an integrator, it could have been hard to understand what is going on. But our team communicated well with each other using e-mail, group text, and group facebook cahts. I think we will be better prepared for next time. One things I wish we had known earlier was the importance of python or iPython for this project.

__Jody__:
+ To further the analysis, we could break the visual / graph down between different learning styles and analyze how they stand in relation to each other and the number of skills learned. 
  + A question would also be around is this more descriptive or conclusive with 31 data points, since 17 were omitted?
+ Moving forward, our group could use iPython Notebook as a way to present, even though it was coded in R. 
+ Overall, I think we focused on the process and tried to answer an interesting question, and learn more about our classmates and any shared characteristics among students who are comfortable at being a technical lead, going beyond analyzing two variables against each other and plotting to see what the relationship is.
+ We could also look into other creative visualizations.
