Talked to Aaron from 11 - 11:10 am

####Takeaways:
+ Spoke with Aaron after class regarding his expectations for our group using R versus Python for the assignment
+ Regarding presenting, we can put in an Issue in the Issue Tracker if we have a Plan B and want to use our own laptops on Tuesday in class
  + With the expectation that we've tested it out and ensure that it works
+ Fail early and fail small
+ Focus on the process while completing the assignment, but be able to justify decisions
+ Focusing on the process and asking questions early on, understanding expectations and communicating with each other, the instructors

Group-5 met from 11:10 - 12 pm

####Agenda:
+ Clarify what the assignment is, make sure everyone is on the same page
+ Figure out what variables we want to use in our assignment
+ Discuss what our outline / schedule will be to complete the assignment timely and do so according to each person's schedule and ensuring enough time for everyone to do his / her individual work

####Discussion:
_From OH in the morning, Aaron wanted us to not immediately jump into doing the work, but focus on the process, and in choosing the variables we wanted to use._
+ Our group, post-email conversations, re-reviewed the questionnaire form to look at the variables available to us
+ We looked at the pros and cons of using each one, making sure to include the learning style
+ We already had learning style, group role (entrepreneur, producer, etc.), and classes in following topics cleaned up
  + Per Aaron's comments, we refocused on evaluating the variables to select the best ones for analysis
+ Criteria for variables:
  + Does the variable relate to learning style in any way?
  + Can this variable, coupled with one or more variables, produce interesting analysis?
  + With the variables, can we visualize the analysis in a creative way?
  + Given that we want to come out of the assignment having learned more about our class, what is a unique set of variables to look at?
+ Having realized that we wanted to dig into the data deeper than simply plot a bar chart or a scatter plot of points, we came up with our variables.

_Realizing that we are a group of 4, and we have midterms coming up, we wanted to find a schedule that works for everyone._
+ We shared our other commitments, and decided the weekend was a good time to sync up with one another again.
+ Since we were already moving along, and having some cleaned data, we would further clean the data, pass it along to the analyzer to do data analysis as discussed in the group, and then visualize and work together on how to present.
  + Here, we really focused our discussion on involving everyone's ideas, and making sure we were all on the same page early on. This way, when it comes time to present, the presenter knows what work we've all done, and we know what each other have done.
+ We are aiming to meet again Saturday afternoon, schedule a time with Aaron over the weekend to discuss any road blocks we've run into, and then meet again before class on Tuesday.

####Next Steps:
+ Put in an Issue in the Issue Tracker regarding CSV file
+ For now, proceed past the curator stage; but the code will be cleaned up for easier readability by group
+ Data will be further cleaned based on our variables selected
+ Figure out how to set up a time with Aaron on bCal
