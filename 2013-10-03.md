Takeaways:
+ Spoke with Aaron after class regarding his expectations for our group using R versus Python for the assignment
+ Regarding presenting, we can put in an Issue in the Issue Tracker if we have a Plan B and want to use our own laptops on Tuesday in class
  + With the expectation that we've tested it out and ensure that it works
+ Fail early and fail small
+ Focus on the process while completing the assignment, but be able to justify decisions

Next Steps:
+ Put in an Issue in the Issue Tracker regarding CSV file
+ For now, proceed past the curator stage; but the code will be cleaned up for easier readability by group
