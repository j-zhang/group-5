+ Spoke with Aaron after class regarding his expectations for our group using R versus Python for the assignment
+ Regarding presenting, we can put in an Issue in the Issue Tracker if we have a Plan B and want to use our own laptops on Tuesday in class

+ Fail early and fail small
+ Focus on the process while completing the assignment, but be able to justify decisions
